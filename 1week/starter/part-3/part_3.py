# Follow the instructions in this part of the project. Define and flesh out your function below, which should accept a dictionary as an argument when called, and return a string of the info in that book-dictionary in a user-friendly readable format.

# Code below

def describe_book(book):
    title = book["title"]
    author = book["author"]
    year = book["year"]
    rating = book["rating"]
    pages = book["pages"]

    return f"This book is called {title} written by {author} and published in the year {year}. With an average rating of {rating}, this book has a total length of {pages} pages."

print(describe_book(my_book))



# Once you are finished with that function, create several more functions which return individual pieces of information from the book.

# Code below

def show_authors(book):
    author = book["author"]
    return author

def list_publish_date(book):
    year = book["year"]
    return year

def show_title(book):
    title = book["title"]
    return title

def show_rating(book):
    rating = book["rating"]
    return rating

def show_page_count(book):
    pages = book["pages"]
    return pages


show_authors(my_book)
list_publish_date(my_book)
show_title(my_book)
show_rating(my_book)
show_page_count(my_book)



# Finally, create at least three new functions that might be useful as we expand our home library app. Perhaps thing of a way you could accept additional arguments when the function is called? Also, imagine you have a list filled with dictionaries like above.
